# Pizza Sales Analysis (SQL)

This project analyzes pizza sales data using SQL to demonstrate data analysis on a relational database. The focus of the project is on writing structured SQL queries and interpreting results to extract meaningful insights from sales data.

## Project Overview
The project involves analyzing sales, orders, and product-level information using SQL queries of varying complexity. Queries are organized into basic, intermediate, and advanced levels to address different analytical requirements.

This project demonstrates how SQL can be used to explore business data, compute key metrics, and identify patterns related to sales performance.

## Dataset
The analysis is based on a relational database containing the following tables:
- `orders`
- `order_details`
- `pizzas`
- `pizza_types`

These tables capture order information, pricing details, pizza attributes, and category-level classification.
